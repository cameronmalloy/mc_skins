# Minecraft Skin Generator

SEE BLOG POST FOR ALL INFROMATION REGARDING CREATION AND DESCRIPTION OF MODEL: [cameronmalloy.github.io](https://www.cameronmalloy.github.io/mc-skins.html)

To use, clone into repo.

Next, do the typical virtual environment stuff

`virtualenv env`
`source env/bin/activate`
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Then, you can run `python3 model.py`. It will load the weights and generate 10 images in the `imgs/` directory. Feel free to use the code in `model.py` and adapt to your own use case.
